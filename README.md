# Reflection and Learnings

## GitHub and Ansible 
Collaboration is a direct component of the development process on GitHub. Work is structured into repositories where developers can specify specifications or set team expectations. Then, using the GitHub workflow, developers merely open a pull request to suggest and discuss improvements, launch a branch to work on updates, commit changes to store them, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page. I understand that ansible can be used to deploy bare metal servers, virtualized hosts and hypervisors, network devices, and your environment's underlying architecture. Additionally, it may provide resources, services, and applications inside of your cloud as well as add compute hosts and install services. 

## Monitoring Tools 
Regarding availability, performance, and logging, talk also about the various monitoring tools. Nagios is a tool for monitoring availability that performs routine audits of crucial application, network, and server resource characteristics.Second, Prometheus is one of the tools for performance monitoring that is made to offer monitoring and alerting capabilities for cloud-native systems, including Kubernetes. Last but not least, Elastic Stack is one of the log monitoring tools. Elastic Stack is a collection of open source products created by Elastic to assist customers in taking data from any type of source and in any format and searching, analyzing, and visualizing that data in real-time.

## Containerized Environment
For creating, distributing, and running applications, there is a platform called Docker. Docker makes it possible to decouple your applications from your infrastructure, allowing for fast software delivery. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. The time between writing code and running it in production can be greatly decreased by utilizing Docker's methodology for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly.

## Cloud Services 
The cloud is all about offering remote computing for end users, with the actual software running on dependable, scalable servers rather than on each end user's machine. Infrastructure as a Service is what OpenStack, which belongs to the latter group, is, is (IaaS). In order for other cloud components to function, OpenStack's infrastructure enables users to add additional instances quickly. Typically, a "platform" is then operated by the infrastructure, allowing a developer to produce software applications that are then made available to end users.
